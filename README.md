## FreeGPT
(Ab)uses the [Translate](https://chatgpt.com/translate) endpoint of ChatGPT to give everyone free access to ChatGPT.

This was not setup to be run anything except for onetime testing. It was made as a PoC in roughly 2 hours. Please pay for ChatGPT. It Isn't't be that bad.

Still unpatched after 3 weeks of working (as of 2/14), which is pretty insane. I already reported it to OAI, and I guess they just don't care.
